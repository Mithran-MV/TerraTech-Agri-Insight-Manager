# TerraTech Agri Insight Manager

## Overview
TerraTech Agri Insight Manager is an advanced smart farming solution that integrates **Internet of Things (IoT)**, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, and **Data Analytics** to optimize agricultural practices. The system monitors **real-time soil parameters** such as **NPK levels, pH, temperature, humidity, and electrical conductivity (EC)** to provide farmers with **data-driven insights**. Using **machine learning algorithms**, the platform predicts **optimal fertilizer and water requirements**, reducing wastage and increasing crop yields.

## Features
- 🌱 **Real-time soil monitoring** with IoT sensors (NPK, pH, temperature, humidity, EC).
- 🤖 **AI-powered fertilizer and water prediction** to optimize resource usage.
- 💧 **Automated irrigation and fertilization** based on real-time data.
- 📊 **Machine learning models** for continuous improvement.
- 🌍 **Supports sustainable agriculture** by reducing environmental impact.
